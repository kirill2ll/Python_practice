# You are playing a game, and your goal is to win a legendary item - any legendary item will be good enough. However, it's a tedious process, and it requires quite a bit of farming. The possible items are:
# "Shadowmourne" - requires 250 Shards
# "Valanyr" - requires 250 Fragments
# "Dragonwrath" - requires 250 Motes
# "Shards", "Fragments", and "Motes" are the key materials 	(case-insensitive), and everything else is junk.
# You will be given lines of input in the format:
# "{quantity1} {material1} {quantity2} {material2} â€¦ {quantityN} {materialN}"
# Keep track of the key materials - the first one that reaches 250, wins the race. At that point, you have to print that the corresponding legendary item is obtained.
# In the end, print the remaining shards, fragments, motes in the format:
# "shards: {number_of_shards}
# fragments: {number_of_fragments}
# motes: {number_of_motes}"
# Finally, print the collected junk items in the order of appearance.
